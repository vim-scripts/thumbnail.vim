This plugin is a thumbnail-style buffer selector for Vim.

The basic concept is graphical vim. We should not stay still at old-style
stage. The user interface is largely influenced by the new tab of
Google Chrome. This plugin is also inspired by Launchpad of Mac and unite.vim.

The latest script is available at https://raw.github.com/itchyny/thumbnail.vim/master/plugin/thumbnail.vim
